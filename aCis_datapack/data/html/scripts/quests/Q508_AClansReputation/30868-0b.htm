						Hearing this, you may think that the place has the<br1>
						bustling atmosphere of a metropolitan area. But due to<br1>
						its proximity to the border with Elmore, it always tends<br1>
						to maintain a somewhat tense atmosphere. The two <br1>
						types of atmosphere were always co-mingling and<br1>
						created a unique balance for years.<br>
						But an increasing number of powerful monsters started <br1>
						to be a major menace to this balance. Of course we,<br1>
						the honorable citizens of Aden can not get our hands <br1>
						bloody nor pose a risk to our personal belongings by  <br1>
						sending the city guards into the task of making these  <br1>
						daemons to retreat.<br>
						However, if we find some private army brave enough <br1>
						to join forces with us, there's one thing we can surely <br1>
						grant as a payment given our position and influence, <br1>
						and <font color="LEVEL"> Reputation</font> it is.<br>
						I've been told you lead a personal army, but i'm <br1>
						afraid your fellows may lack the strenght required for <br1>
						we to engage in a business.<br>
						(This quest may only be undertaken by clans of level <br1>
						5 and above)<br>
