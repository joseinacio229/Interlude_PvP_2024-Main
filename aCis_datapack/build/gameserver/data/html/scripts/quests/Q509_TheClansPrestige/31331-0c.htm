						Hearing this, you may think that the place has the<br1>
						bustling atmosphere of a metropolitan area. But due to<br1>
						its proximity to the border with Elmore, it always tends <br1>
						to maintain a somewhat tense atmosphere. The two <br1>
						types of atmosphere were always co-mingling and <br1>
						created a unique balance for years.<br1>
						But an increasing number of powerful monsters known<br1>
						as<font color="LEVEL"> Raid Bosses</font> started to terrorize town's people and<br1>
						are a major menace to this balance. Of course we, the<br1>
						honorable citizens of Aden can not get our hands bloody<br1>
						nor pose a risk to our personal belongings by sending<br1>
						the city guards into the task of making these daemons<br1>
						to retreat.<br1>
						However, if we find some private army brave enough to <br1>
						join forces with us, there's one thing we can surely grant <br1>
						as a payment given our position and influence, and <br1>
						<font color="LEVEL"> Reputation</font> it is.<br1>
						I've been told you lead a personal army. Of course we <br1>
						know a leader like you won't have to risk his life on the<br1>
						task, so if you can grant your subordinates will <br1>
						accomplish our requests i can give you further details,<br1>
						what you say?<br>
